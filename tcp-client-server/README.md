# TCP-Server

An example of a TCP client/server created using Python's socket and threading library. 
The server uses instances of a client class and individual threads to listen to incoming data from each client while listening for new connections. 
The messages sent by the client are stored in the SQLite3 database. Only for the **testing** purpose.
